**CBCT Dataset for Deep Learning-based Segmentation and Virtual Surgical Planning in Bimaxillary Surgery**

Abstract

Virtual Surgical Planning (VSP) is essential for patient-centric care in craniomaxillofacial surgeries, particularly in bimaxillary orthognathic surgeries involving maxilla and mandible repositioning. VSP in bimaxillary orthognathic surgery requires 3D surface models of the target structure that rely on accurate segmentation from imaging data, such as Computed Tomography (CT) or Cone-Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) scans. Accurate maxilla segmentation is vital yet challenging due to its complex morphology compared to the mandible. While manual maxilla segmentation remains common, it is time-consuming, laborious, and lacks reproducibility. To address these limitations, automating maxilla segmentation using Deep Learning methods is proposed. However, it's important to acknowledge that manual segmentation is an important step as the gold standard for validating purposes in supervised deep learning methods. To the best of our knowledge, there are no publicly available maxilla-labeled datasets. In this study, we present the first open-access high-quality collection of CBCT images and corresponding maxilla labels from patients who underwent orthognathic surgery called MaxSeg.

CBCT artifacts caused by orthodontic brackets are illustrated in different views. This figure presents four views from a CBCT (Cone Beam Computed Tomography) scan, labeled as Orthodontics, Sagittal, Coronal, and Axial. Each view highlights artifacts caused by orthodontic brackets, marked with a red circle or lines.
